This update transforms the original notebook into a better monitoring programme workflow based on NDVI timelapse.

Monthly datasets: Datasets are aggregated monthly, to match in time, NDVI (average value), Rainfall (cumulative value) and LST (average value).

Baseline & anomalies: created a climatology of 2001-2010 and analyse monthly anomalies that point out when the landscapes were greener, drier or hotter than usual.

Visualization: Used clearer color palettes to represent both absolute values and anomalies, so that patterns can be more readily identified.

GIF exports: Changed to dimension based export to address the stability of this export method and tidied up the AOI handling to remove pixel limit issues in the Earth Engine.

Dates: Every GIF frame now contains a neat label of months and years (the labels use white text with black outline, so they are clearly visible when watching the animation).

Regional CSVs: Included Drive exports of monthly NDVI, Rain and LST averages to be plotted/analyzed further.

Lag analysis: Made available the possibility to analyze an impact of rainfall on NDVI with a configurable lag (1-month delay).


######
anomaly explaination - as baseline 2001-2010 have been chosen. mean or average of each month from 2001-2011 has been considered as the standard mark for anomaly detection.
for example assume from 2001-2010 july had an ndvi of .7
now this 0.7 has been considered as the stardard for anomaly detection. 
+- 0.3 compared to 0.7 value of each year (here 2001-2025) in the month of july will considered as anomaly.
